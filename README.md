# Nextjs App with Redux Toolkit and Typescript
In this application I learned to integrate Redux Toolkit in Nextjs (using the app folder or app directory) in addition to using Typescript, this is an example from scratch but it still requires the developer to already know concepts such as React, API Context, and bases of Nextjs, since the project focuses more on how to configure it and use it in applications, in addition we will also use its methods to request data using fetch below, and setting it to its state, although this is done by default Redux Toolkit.
